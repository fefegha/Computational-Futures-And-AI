# Lesson steps.
To become familiar with Magenta.js and RNN models for generating music.
To become familiar with RNN models for artistic applications of machine learning.ß

## 1. Code tutorial for the lesson
So today, we won't be using p5.js! 
So open your code editor (Visual Studio Code/Atom)!

I found this really good tutorial which is called ["Getting Started with Magenta.js and MusicRNN"](https://medium.com/@oluwafunmi.ojo/getting-started-with-magenta-js-e7ffbcb64c21) by Funmi Ojo.

You would need an index.html for all your HTML code and you would need an index.js for all your javascript code!

Have a read, try it out and see if you can make your own melody after! 

I am around so I can answer questions!

## SketchRNN Tutorial (Try it over the hols)
Watch this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCXkvwLxBrA) by Daniel Shiffman on using the pre-trained SketchRNN machine learning model (available with the ml5.js library) to create a p5.js sketch that finishes a person’s drawing.

## Markov Chains Tutorial
Watch these two tutorials by Daniel Shiffman on how to create Markov Chains.
