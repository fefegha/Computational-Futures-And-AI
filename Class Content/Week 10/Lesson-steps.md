# Lesson steps.
To become familiar with Magenta.js and RNN models for generating music.
To become familiar with RNN models for artistic applications of machine learning.ß

## 1. Code tutorial for the lesson
Changed this tutorial ["Getting Started with Magenta.js and MusicRNN"](https://medium.com/@oluwafunmi.ojo/getting-started-with-magenta-js-e7ffbcb64c21) by Funmi Ojo.

to this - ["Magenta.js and MusicRNN in p5.js"](https://editor.p5js.org/fefegha/sketches/K_lsINeZ7) which is based on https://hello-magenta.glitch.me/

Play around with the code and see how it works! See if you can attempt to implement your own.

## SketchRNN Tutorial (Try it over the hols)
Watch this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCXkvwLxBrA) by Daniel Shiffman on using the pre-trained SketchRNN machine learning model (available with the ml5.js library) to create a p5.js sketch that finishes a person’s drawing.

## Markov Chains Tutorial
Watch these two tutorials by Daniel Shiffman on how to create Markov Chains.
