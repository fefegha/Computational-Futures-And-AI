# Lesson steps.

To explore the Google “Quick, Draw!” dataset.
To understand how to work with image data for training your own model.

## 1. Download Processing

For today's lesson, you would need to download Processing. 
You won't need to know Java for this lesson, as the third and fourth step will guide you through the process <i>(pun on words)</i>. 

To download Processing, click [here](https://processing.org/download/) and download the right format (Windows or Mac OS X) for your device of choice!

## 2. Explore the Datasets

The Quick Draw Dataset is a collection of 50 million drawings across 345 categories, contributed by players of the game Quick, Draw!. The drawings were captured as timestamped vectors, tagged with metadata including what the player was asked to draw and in which country the player was located. 

Check out the Github repo [here](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset). 
I suggest to play the [game](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/) again to refresh your memory.

Once you played the game and explored the Github repo, the next step would be to download three datasets of your choice from this [list](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/quickdraw_dataset/full/numpy_bitmap). 

## 3. Watch video

This step is for you to watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7U6WA7Ffk) by Daniel Shiffman of The Coding Train who will teach you on how to parse the Google Quick Draw dataset with Processing and prepare it for use with p5.js + ml5.js.

## 4. Follow the steps in the video

If you did this step while watching the video, you could skip this! 

However if you have not, please do follow the steps in the video with the datasets you want to play with as this will help you for the next step!

## 5. Attempt to input data set into code that Alex has written

The final step! 
I already got a [p5.js + ml5.js sketch](https://editor.p5js.org/fefegha/sketches/eMxONsRSu) set up with my own doddle classifier.

Play with it first, explore how the code works. 

Once you have done that, discard mine and upload your datasets and make the code changes! 

Try it out and see if your doodle classifier is working!

Have fun!
